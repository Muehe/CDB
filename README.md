# ClassicDB
ClassicDB is an addon for World of Warcraft (1.12.1), which helps you to find ingame stuff and getting your quests done. It draws spawn information of gameobjects and NPCs on your map. Also it allows you to search for quests, items and much more. Cartographer is required and an enhanced version is included in the download.

**Note:** ClassicDB is not meant to be a complete QuestHelper clone (although it is slowly getting there). It is a database, in the spirit of the amazing "Wow Head Data Base" addon and offers some kind of quest integration via a simple UI. If you are searching for a real QuestHelper addon you might want to check out a project called [Questie](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev) instead of ClassicDB (or just use both together).

# Credits
Initially developed as ShaguQuest 8, ClassicDB is a fork of [WHDB](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/whdb) for TBC by UniRing, which was ported to classic WoW by Bërsërk in the RQP (Rapid Quest Pack) addon collection. It was merged together from two independently developed forks, [ShaguQuest](https://github.com/shagu/shaguquest) and [Continued WHDB](https://github.com/Muehe/WHDB). ClassicDB is based on data from [cmangos/classic-db](https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db), as well as [MangosExtras/MangosZero_Localised](https://github.com/MangosExtras/MangosZero_Localised/tree/master/Translations) for translations used in the deDE version.

# Download
If you want to test it, you can download it on the [Releases](https://github.com/Muehe/CDB/releases) page (coming soon).
