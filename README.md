# ShaguDB
ShaguDB is an Addon for World of Warcraft Classic (1.12.1) Clients, which helps you to find ingame stuff and getting your quests done. It draws spawn informations of gameobjects and npcs on your map. Also it allows you to search for quests, items and much more. It is based on the latest [cmangos classic-db](https://github.com/cmangos/classic-db), as well as [MangosZero_Localised](https://github.com/MangosExtras/MangosZero_Localised/tree/master/Translations) for deDE versions. Some parts of the Addon itself are taken from the amazing WHDB Addon. Cartographer is required and an enhanced version is included in the download.

Note: ShaguQuest is not meant to be a complete QuestHelper Clone (although it's slowly getting there). It's a database addon which offers some kind of quest integration via a simple UI. If you're searching for a real QuestHelper Addon you might want to checkout a project called [Questie](https://github.com/AeroScripts/QuestieDev) instead of ShaguQuest (or just use both together).
